# Labyrinth Pathfinder Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based solution for a labyrinth pathfinding problem, developed as part of an interview exercise.

## Programming Principles Leveraged
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes classes and objects for managing the labyrinth and rod.
- Algorithmic Efficiency: BFS for optimal pathfinding in a maze.
- Modularity: Code is organized into classes and functions for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Unit Testing: Ensures code quality and functionality.
- File Handling: Reads labyrinth layout from a file, enabling easy testing with different mazes.

## Technologies
- Python: Main programming language.
- Unittest Framework: For implementing unit tests to ensure code reliability.

## How It Works
The Pathfinder navigates the labyrinth, which can contain obstacles, using BFS. It accounts for the rod's orientation and checks for valid moves, rotation possibilities, and end conditions.
